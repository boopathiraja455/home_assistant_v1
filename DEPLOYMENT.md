# WiFi Monitor PWA - Deployment Guide

## Quick Start

The WiFi Monitor PWA is now ready for deployment. Here's how to get it running:

### Development Mode
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```
The built app will be available at `http://localhost:4173`

## Configuration

### Basic Setup
1. Edit `public/config.json` to set your WiFi network:
```json
{
  "targetSSID": "YourWiFiNetwork",
  "timer1Duration": 7,
  "timer2Duration": 8,
  "durationUnit": "hours"
}
```

### Testing Mode
For quick testing, use shorter durations:
```json
{
  "targetSSID": "YourWiFiNetwork",
  "timer1Duration": 30,
  "timer2Duration": 60,
  "durationUnit": "seconds",
  "debug": {
    "mockMode": true
  }
}
```

- Timer countdown displays
- Manual override controls
- Configuration display

✅ **Testing Features**
- Mock WiFi connection simulation
- Manual timer testing
- Debug logging
- Configuration override

## Browser Limitations

⚠️ **Important Notes**
- Browsers cannot directly access WiFi SSID information
- Background processing is limited by browser policies
- Auto-start functionality requires user interaction
- HTTPS is required for full PWA functionality

## Deployment Options

### 1. Static Hosting (Recommended)
Deploy the `dist/` folder to:
- **Netlify**: Drag & drop deployment with HTTPS
- **Vercel**: Git-based deployment
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting with custom domains
- **Firebase Hosting**: Google's static hosting

### 2. Self-Hosting
```bash
# Using a simple HTTP server
npx serve dist -p 3000

# Using Python
cd dist && python -m http.server 3000

# Using Node.js
npm install -g http-server
cd dist && http-server -p 3000
```

### 3. Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html/
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

## Testing the App

### 1. Basic Functionality
1. Open the app in a modern browser
2. Grant notification permissions when prompted
3. Check the dashboard displays correctly
4. Test manual connection time override

### 2. Mock Mode Testing
1. Enable `mockMode` in config.json
2. Use "Simulate Connection" button
3. Watch timers activate and count down
4. Test notifications when timers trigger

### 3. PWA Installation
1. Look for install prompt in browser
2. Install as PWA on desktop/mobile
3. Test offline functionality
4. Verify service worker registration

### 4. Notification Testing
1. Set short timer durations (30 seconds)
2. Simulate connection
3. Wait for timer notifications
4. Test fullscreen modal alerts

## Production Configuration

### For Real Use
```json
{
  "targetSSID": "YourActualWiFiNetwork",
  "timer1Duration": 7,
  "timer2Duration": 8,
  "durationUnit": "hours",
  "notifications": {
    "enabled": true,
    "sound": true
  },
  "debug": {
    "mockMode": false,
    "logLevel": "error"
  }
}
```

### Security Considerations
- Serve over HTTPS in production
- Consider Content Security Policy headers
- Validate configuration inputs
- Monitor service worker updates

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App not loading:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify all files are served correctly
- Ensure HTTPS in production

**Notifications not working:**
- Check browser notification permissions
- Verify HTTPS connection
- Test with different browsers

**Timers not triggering:**
- Check browser tab isn't suspended
- Verify localStorage access
- Review configuration settings

**PWA not installing:**
- Confirm HTTPS connection
- Check manifest.json validity
- Verify service worker registration

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for logs
- Inspect Application tab in DevTools
- Verify service worker status
- Check localStorage/IndexedDB data

## Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Native Integration**: Browser extension for true WiFi monitoring
2. **Push Notifications**: Server-side notifications for better reliability
3. **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights
4. **Sync**: Cloud synchronization across devices
5. **Themes**: Light/dark mode toggle
6. **Advanced Timers**: Multiple custom timers
7. **Integrations**: Calendar, task management systems

### Enterprise Deployment
For enterprise use, consider:
- Native desktop application
- Browser extension with WiFi permissions
- System service integration
- Centralized configuration management

## Support

The app is designed to work within browser limitations while providing maximum functionality possible in a web environment. For production use requiring true background WiFi monitoring, consider native application development or browser extensions with appropriate permissions.
